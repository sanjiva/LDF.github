Lanka Data Foundation (LDF) is a not-for-profit organization working to make public data accessible, connected, and useful.

We view data not as isolated numbers, but as a foundation for accountability, transparency, and informed citizenship. Much public information exists in fragmented silos; LDF focuses on sourcing, curating, and linking these datasets to create meaningful insights that help people understand institutions, decisions, and systems over time.

Our work makes verified, high-quality public data available through open platforms, tools, and APIs - supporting citizens, researchers, journalists, technologists, and other public‑minded organizations. Through this, LDF aims to strengthen democratic participation and contribute to a more transparent and accountable society.

## What We Build

Our work is structured around two core areas that support how public data is collected, connected, and shared:

### Data Platform

The data platform focuses on the infrastructure and APIs needed to model, connect, and reuse public data at scale.

- Systems to collect, store, and retrieve large-scale public data
- APIs and services for programmatic access to datasets
- Backend frameworks integrating different types of databases
- Tools that enable data reuse by applications, researchers, and organizations

### Information Hub

The information hub focuses on access, exploration, and understanding of public data.

- Curated and structured public datasets published in open formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Archives of government documents, gazettes, and public records
- Search, browse, and discovery interfaces for public information
- Applications and tools to visualize, analyze, and explore data interactively
